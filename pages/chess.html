    <title>Idea: Chess Set</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> Electronic Chess Set </h1>
    <img src="../images/chezz.jpeg" alt="Black and Gold Chess Set">
    
    <p> The idea for this chess set is to have it mimic the gameplay of Chess.com </p>
    <p> For example, you could pick up a piece, and the set would glow underneath to show what moves are available.</p>
    <p> I've decided the best and cheapest way to go about this is to have a magnet under each of the pieces and magnetic switches inside of the board</p>

    <h2><strong>I've separated it into two possible versions</strong></h2>
    <h3><em>Mark 1</em></h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>Each piece uses 1 magnet, pieces are determined from computer</li>
        <li>Pros: much simpler, less programming needed</li>
        <li>Cons: depends on computer, everything would probably need to start from normal spots</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Mark 2</strong></h3>    
        <li>Each piece uses different magnets to actually distinguish between pieces</li>
        <li>Pros: more robust</li>
        <li>Cons: more complicated, needs more switches</li>
    </ul>
