    <p> The idea for this is to fully design my own keyboard, pcb and all. </p>
    <p> I know that I want to have the case made out of acrylic, as it is an easy and cheap material to work with, and I like the design. </p>
    <p> The biggest hurdle to get over will definitely be learning the PCB design.</p>
